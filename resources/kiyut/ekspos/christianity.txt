How much does God loves us?
---------------------------

No one has to earn God's love. No one has to jump through hoops to earn his acceptance. No one has to crawl on his hands and knees to compensate for past sins. No one has to do such things because God already loves use. He has shown His love for us by the sacrifice of His son.

The bible states, "God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). Through the suffering of Jesus, we see the terribleness of our rebellion and the extent of God's love for us.

All we must do to experience His love is believe that He has done for use what we could not do for ourselves (Roman 4:5). The answer is not to try harder to please God but to trust what Christ has done for us. God's love is offered to us as gift, not a reward (Ephesians 2:8-10).

The apostle Paul wrote, "if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be save .... For 'whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved'" (Romans 10:9-13). That's how much God loves us.

If you've never asked for forgiveness of your sin, pray something like this: "God, thank You for loving me so much. I realize that in my thoughts and actions I have broken Your holy law. I believe that You sent Your Son Jesus to take the punishment that i deserved. I believe He died for me and then rose again. I now accept Your loving offer of forgiveness.  
Amen."

If you prayed that from your heart, tell others what you have done. Also, be sure to seek out the fellowship of believers who can help you to study the Bible and grow in Christlikeness.
